# Emergency Access

## Bitwarden Password safe
I have setup an emergency access system for my passwords.  
1. Login using the details below
2. Go to `Settings`
3. Go to `Emergency access`
4. Select request to start the emergency access. This will take 30 days before you will have access to my password vault.

Email: `hopefullysecret@email.com`
Password: `password:SOME-SECRET-PASSWORD`
